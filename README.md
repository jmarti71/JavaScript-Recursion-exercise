# JavaScript-Recursion-Exercise

My solutions for the Odin Project's recursion exercises.

- Fibonacci Sequence: The recursion.js file contains an iterative and a recursive function that takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence.

- Merge Sort: The mergesort.js file contains a solution that sorts a given array by using "merge sort" function(s).
